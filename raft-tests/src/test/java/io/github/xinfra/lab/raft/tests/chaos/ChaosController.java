/**
 * Shared fault-injection state for a cluster of {@link ChaosTransport}s. One
 * controller is created per test and handed to every node's transport, so a
 * single call partitions or heals a link as seen by both endpoints.
 *
 * <p>Faults are evaluated per directed link {@code (from -> to)}:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Isolation</b> — an isolated node drops every message it would send
 *       and every message addressed to it, in both directions. Models a node
 *       that fell off the network entirely.</li>
 *   <li><b>Partition</b> — two groups that cannot exchange messages, but each
 *       group's internal links stay healthy. Models a network split.</li>
 *   <li><b>Drop probability</b> — a global per-message loss rate, for
 *       lossy-link / chaos soak testing. Raft tolerates loss, so the cluster
 *       must still converge.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>All mutators are safe to call from a test thread while the cluster runs;
 * reads on the hot path ({@link #shouldDrop}) are lock-free.
